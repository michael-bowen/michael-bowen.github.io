The\n\t\t      primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method, which\n\t\t      registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the reason\n\t\t      why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n\t\n\t\t      Terminology\n\t\t      -----------\n\t\n\t\t      - `promise` is an object or function with a `then` method whose behavior conforms to this specification.\n\t\t      - `thenable` is an object or function that defines a `then` method.\n\t\t      - `value` is any legal JavaScript value (including undefined, a thenable, or a promise).\n\t\t      - `exception` is a value that is thrown using the throw statement.\n\t\t      - `reason` is a value that indicates why a promise was rejected.\n\t\t      - `settled` the final resting state of a promise, fulfilled or rejected.\n\t\n\t\t      A promise can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.\n\t\n\t\t      Promises that are fulfilled have a fulfillment value and are in the fulfilled\n\t\t      state.  Promises that are rejected have a rejection reason and are in the\n\t\t      rejected state.  A fulfillment value is never a thenable.\n\t\n\t\t      Promises can also be said to *resolve* a value.  If this value is also a\n\t\t      promise, then the original promise's settled state will match the value's\n\t\t      settled state.  So a promise that *resolves* a promise that rejects will\n\t\t      itself reject, and a promise that *resolves* a promise that fulfills will\n\t\t      itself fulfill.\n\t\n\t\n\t\t      Basic Usage:\n\t\t      ------------\n\t\n\t\t      ```js\n\t\t      var promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n\t\t        // on success\n\t\t        resolve(value);\n\t\n\t\t        // on failure\n\t\t        reject(reason);\n\t\t      });\n\t\n\t\t      promise.then(function(value) {\n\t\t        // on fulfillment\n\t\t      }, function(reason) {\n\t\t        // on rejection\n\t\t      });\n\t\t      ```\n\t\n\t\t      Advanced Usage:\n\t\t      ---------------\n\t\n\t\t      Promises shine when abstracting away asynchronous interactions such as\n\t\t      `XMLHttpRequest`s.\n\t\n\t\t      ```js\n\t\t      function getJSON(url) {\n\t\t        return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n\t\t          var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n\t\n\t\t          xhr.open('GET', url);\n\t\t          xhr.onreadystatechange = handler;\n\t\t          xhr.responseType = 'json';\n\t\t          xhr.setRequestHeader('Accept', 'application/json');\n\t\t          xhr.send();\n\t\n\t\t          function handler() {\n\t\t            if (this.readyState === this.DONE) {\n\t\t              if (this.status === 200) {\n\t\t                resolve(this.response);\n\t\t              } else {\n\t\t                reject(new Error('getJSON: `' + url + '` failed with status: [' + this.status + ']'));\n\t\t              }\n\t\t            }\n\t\t          };\n\t\t        });\n\t\t      }\n\t\n\t\t      getJSON('/posts.json').then(function(json) {\n\t\t        // on fulfillment\n\t\t      }, function(reason) {\n\t\t        // on rejection\n\t\t      });\n\t\t      ```\n\t\n\t\t      Unlike callbacks, promises are great composable primitives.\n\t\n\t\t      ```js\n\t\t      Promise.all([\n\t\t        getJSON('/posts'),\n\t\t        getJSON('/comments')\n\t\t      ]).then(function(values){\n\t\t        values[0] // => postsJSON\n\t\t        values[1] // => commentsJSON\n\t\n\t\t        return values;\n\t\t      });\n\t\t      ```\n\t\n\t\t      @class Promise\n\t\t      @param {function} resolver\n\t\t      Useful for tooling.\n\t\t      @constructor\n\t\t    */\n\t\t    function lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise(resolver) {\n\t\t      this._id = lib$es6$promise$promise$$counter++;\n\t\t      this._state = undefined;\n\t\t      this._result = undefined;\n\t\t      this._subscribers = [];\n\t\n\t\t      if (lib$es6$promise$$internal$$noop !== resolver) {\n\t\t        if (!lib$es6$promise$utils$$isFunction(resolver)) {\n\t\t          lib$es6$promise$promise$$needsResolver();\n\t\t        }\n\t\n\t\t        if (!(this instanceof lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise)) {\n\t\t          lib$es6$promise$promise$$needsNew();\n\t\t        }\n\t\n\t\t        lib$es6$promise$$internal$$initializePromise(this, resolver);\n\t\t      }\n\t\t    }\n\t\n\t\t    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.all = lib$es6$promise$promise$all$$default;\n\t\t    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.race = lib$es6$promise$promise$race$$default;\n\t\t    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.resolve = lib$es6$promise$promise$resolve$$default;\n\t\t    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.reject = lib$es6$promise$promise$reject$$default;\n\t\t    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise._setScheduler = lib$es6$promise$asap$$setScheduler;\n\t\t    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise._setAsap = lib$es6$promise$asap$$setAsap;\n\t\t    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise._asap = lib$es6$promise$asap$$asap;\n\t\n\t\t    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.prototype = {\n\t\t      constructor: lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise,\n\t\n\t\t    /**\n\t\t      The primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method,\n\t\t      which registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the\n\t\t      reason why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n\t\n\t\t      ```js\n\t\t      findUser().then(function(user){\n\t\t        // user is available\n\t\t      }, function(reason){\n\t\t        // user is unavailable, and you are given the reason why\n\t\t      });\n\t\t      ```\n\t\n\t\t      Chaining\n\t\t      --------\n\t\n\t\t      The return value of `then` is itself a promise.

 Promise objects represent the eventual result of an asynchronous operation. The\n\t      primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method, which\n\t      registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the reason\n\t      why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n\n\t      Terminology\n\t      -----------\n\n\t      - `promise` is an object or function with a `then` method whose behavior conforms to this specification.\n\t      - `thenable` is an object or function that defines a `then` method.\n\t      - `value` is any legal JavaScript value (including undefined, a thenable, or a promise).\n\t      - `exception` is a value that is thrown using the throw statement.\n\t      - `reason` is a value that indicates why a promise was rejected.\n\t      - `settled` the final resting state of a promise, fulfilled or rejected.\n\n\t      A promise can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.\n\n\t      Promises that are fulfilled have a fulfillment value and are in the fulfilled\n\t      state.  Promises that are rejected have a rejection reason and are in the\n\t      rejected state.  A fulfillment value is never a thenable.\n\n\t      Promises can also be said to *resolve* a value.  If this value is also a\n\t      promise, then the original promise's settled state will match the value's\n\t      settled state.  So a promise that *resolves* a promise that rejects will\n\t      itself reject, and a promise that *resolves* a promise that fulfills will\n\t      itself fulfill.\n\n\n\t      Basic Usage:\n\t      ------------\n\n\t      ```js\n\t      var promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n\t        // on success\n\t        resolve(value);\n\n\t        // on failure\n\t        reject(reason);\n\t      });\n\n\t      promise.then(function(value) {\n\t        // on fulfillment\n\t      }, function(reason) {\n\t        // on rejection\n\t      });\n\t      ```\n\n\t      Advanced Usage:\n\t      ---------------\n\n\t      Promises shine when abstracting away asynchronous interactions such as\n\t      `XMLHttpRequest`s.\n\n\t      ```js\n\t      function getJSON(url) {\n\t        return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n\t          var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n\n\t          xhr.open('GET', url);\n\t          xhr.onreadystatechange = handler;\n\t          xhr.responseType = 'json';\n\t          xhr.setRequestHeader('Accept', 'application/json');\n\t          xhr.send();\n\n\t          function handler() {\n\t            if (this.readyState === this.DONE) {\n\t              if (this.status === 200) {\n\t                resolve(this.response);\n\t              } else {\n\t                reject(new Error('getJSON: `' + url + '` failed with status: [' + this.status + ']'));\n\t              }\n\t            }\n\t          };\n\t        });\n\t      }\n\n\t      getJSON('/posts.json').then(function(json) {\n\t        // on fulfillment\n\t      }, function(reason) {\n\t        // on rejection\n\t      });\n\t      ```\n\n\t      Unlike callbacks, promises are great composable primitives.\n\n\t      ```js\n\t      Promise.all([\n\t        getJSON('/posts'),\n\t        getJSON('/comments')\n\t      ]).then(function(values){\n\t        values[0] // => postsJSON\n\t        values[1] // => commentsJSON\n\n\t        return values;\n\t      });\n\t      ```\n\n\t      @class Promise\n\t      @param {function} resolver\n\t      Useful for tooling.\n\t      @constructor\n\t    */\n\t    function lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise(resolver) {\n\t      this._id = lib$es6$promise$promise$$counter++;\n\t      this._state = undefined;\n\t      this._result = undefined;\n\t      this._subscribers = [];\n\n\t      if (lib$es6$promise$$internal$$noop !== resolver) {\n\t        if (!lib$es6$promise$utils$$isFunction(resolver)) {\n\t          lib$es6$promise$promise$$needsResolver();\n\t        }\n\n\t        if (!(this instanceof lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise)) {\n\t          lib$es6$promise$promise$$needsNew();\n\t        }\n\n\t        lib$es6$promise$$internal$$initializePromise(this, resolver);\n\t      }\n\t    }\n\n\t    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.all = lib$es6$promise$promise$all$$default;\n\t    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.race = lib$es6$promise$promise$race$$default;\n\t    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.resolve = lib$es6$promise$promise$resolve$$default;\n\t    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.reject = lib$es6$promise$promise$reject$$default;\n\t    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise._setScheduler = lib$es6$promise$asap$$setScheduler;\n\t    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise._setAsap = lib$es6$promise$asap$$setAsap;\n\t    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise._asap = lib$es6$promise$asap$$asap;\n\n\t    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.prototype = {\n\t      constructor: lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise,\n\n\t    /**\n\t      The primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method,\n\t      which registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the\n\t      reason why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n\n\t      ```js\n\t      findUser().then(function(user){\n\t        // user is available\n\t      }, function(reason){\n\t        // user is unavailable, and you are given the reason why\n\t      });\n\t      ```\n\n\t      Chaining\n\t      --------\n\n\t      The return value of `then` is itself a promise.
